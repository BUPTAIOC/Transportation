(1) The above two folders correspond to two real-world road networks (i.e., the Mandl’s road network and a real-world transit network in a region in Beijing, China), respectively. 
(2) The Mandl’s road network was provided by C. E. Mandl in 1980. It is an actual road network in Switzerland and consists of 15 nodes and 15,570 trip demands per day. 
    The Mandl’s road network is a small-scale road network has become a benchmark problem instance in the transit route network optimization problem. 
(3) The real-world transit network is a large-scale road network and has total 301 bus stations, 3758 road sections, and 29 bus lines.
(4) The Problem Instances of Benchmark Mandl's Road Network folder provides four problem instances of Mandl's road network, i.e., Mandl-8, Mandl1-12, Mandl-10, Mandl2-12; 
    The Problem Instances of A Large Scale Public Transit Route Network folder provides three problem instances of the large-scale transit network, i.e., Major-1, Major-2, Major-3.
