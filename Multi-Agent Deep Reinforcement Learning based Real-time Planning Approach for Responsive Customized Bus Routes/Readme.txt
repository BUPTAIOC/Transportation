1. Each of the two road networks (Sioux and Major) has a folder, which contains two files. Take the folder "Sioux" as an example. It has two files, i.e. sioux_stops.csv and sioux_time.csv. The sioux_stops.csv stores station locations of the sioux_0 (sioux_1) CB network, and the sioux_time.csv file stores the travel time distribution of the sioux_0 (sioux_1) CB network.

2. Python code "instance.py" is a demo to call the files in folders "Sioux" and "Major" to generate training, validation and test data sets for the three CB netwoks, respectively.

3. Detailed notes on how to generate data sets are given in "instances.py". In addition to the above Sioux_0, Sioux_1 and Major CB problem instances, researchers can generate more new CB problem instances according to their needs.

4. The source code folder contains the main programs of the three problem instances, (sioux_0, sioux_1 and major), which are MRL_Sioux0, MRL_Sioux1 and MRL_Major folders respectively. Taking Sioux_0 as an example, the MRL_Sioux0 folder contains the folders Off_CB_model and On_CB_model, which correspond to the offline scenario and the online scenario for the sioux_0. The Off_CB_model (On_CB_model) folder contains two python files: off_magent_model (on_magent_model) and sioux0_off_magent_trainer (sioux0_on_magent_trainer). The off_magent_model (on_magent_model) python file is used to implement the multi-agent system of sioux0 and is called by the sioux0_off_magent_trainer (sioux0_on_magent_trainer) python file. The sioux0_off_magent_trainer (sioux0_on_magent_trainer) python file is the main program, which calls the multi-agent system program and the problem instance environment program to implement the training of the multi-agent system. 

5. The guidance of the selection of coefficients , i.e Guidance_coefficients.txt, details how to define the coefficients for the return function.
