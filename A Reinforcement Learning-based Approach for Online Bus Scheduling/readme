This repository contains 4 real-world BSP instances in Qingdao city, China, which is used in our paper:

> **《A Reinforcement Learning-based Approach for Online Bus Scheduling》**

> There are two main parts：
>
> 1.  **Information of four BSP instances**
> 2. **Timetable and travel time of 4 instances**
